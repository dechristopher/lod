# LOD Security Policy

While LOD's security footprint isn't very large, we do take it seriously. 
If you find there are any vulnerable library versions or holes in our configuration
checks that could impact a user's system or infrastructure, please let us know.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| <1.0.0  | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Email one of our maintainers directly using contact information found in their profiles.
Prioritize Andrew DeChristopher <me@dchr.host>. For non-critical issues, please just open
an issue or a PR with a fix and we'll be right on it.
